# Javascript and DOM Manipulation

Eye-witness reports on UFO sightings have been reported and stored into the data.js I have created a webpage in which users can navigate through the data for further analysis. The coding used in this includes:

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- D3.js

## D3.js

The D3.js library produces dynamic and interactive data visualistions on web pages. Users can filter through the reports in question by the select dropdown box that includes the following columns:

1. `date/time`
2. `city`
3. `state`
4. `country`
5. `shape`
